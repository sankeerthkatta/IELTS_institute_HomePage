## Design Choices

- **Responsive Layout:** All components use Tailwind CSS utility classes for a modern, mobile-friendly UI.
- **Consistent Branding:** The primary blue color (`rgb(11,66,142)`) is used throughout for buttons, highlights, and icons.
- **React Icons:** Icons are imported from `react-icons` for visual clarity and consistency in navigation, features, and footer.
- **Component Structure:** The UI is split into clear sections—Navbar, Hero, Features, Testimonials, and Footer—for maintainability and scalability.
- **Accessibility:** Buttons and navigation are keyboard accessible, and images include descriptive `alt` text.
- **Mobile Navigation:** The Navbar includes a hamburger menu for easy access on smaller screens.
